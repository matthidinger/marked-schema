# marked-schema

This package is a fork from [wetzel](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/wetzel)

It generates markdown documentation from a JSON-schema with support for 

1. A TOC to specify the order of types
2. A path to examples for each property in the objects

> NOTE: This package is pretty tightly coupled to the AdaptiveCards json-schema right now and may need significant tweaks to work with your schema.
